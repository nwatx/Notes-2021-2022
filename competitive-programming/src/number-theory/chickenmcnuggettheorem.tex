\subsection{Chicken McNugget Theorem}

The highest solution that satisfies the equation

$$
ax + by = c : \{a, b, c \in \mathbb{Z}\}
$$

where $a$ and $b$ are coprime is equivalent to $ab - a - b$

\begin{example}[Art of Problem Solving]
	Joe is at McDonalds, which sells McNuggets in packs of $9$ and $11$.
	What is the highest number of McNuggets he cannot buy?
\end{example}

Testing $1$ vs 1

By Chicken McNugget theorem, since $\gcd(9, 11) = 1$, then the answer is
$9\cdot 11 - 9 - 11 = 79$ McNuggets.
