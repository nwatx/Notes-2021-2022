\section{Can you taste the "diet" in diet soda}

Some people claim that they can tell the difference between a diet soda and a regular soda in the
first sip. A researcher wanting to test this claim randomly sampled 80 such people. He then filled
80 plain white cups with soda, half diet and half regular through random assignment, and asked
each person to take one sip from their cup and identify the soda as diet or regular. Fifty-three
participants correctly identified the soda. Do these data provide strong evidence that these people
are able to detect the difference between diet and regular soda (i.e. that they are doing better
than expected by random guessing)?

\section{State}


$H_0: p = 0.5$, $H_a: p > 0.5, \alpha = 0.05$
where $p$ is the proportion of people who identify the diet soda correctly.

\section{Plan}

\begin{itemize}
	\item 80 people is less than 10\% of all people.
	\item The 80 people are randomly sampled.
	% \item Let's define $p$ as the proportion that correctly identify the soda.
	% \item The people who correctly identified the soda are independent of
	% the people who did not correctly identify the soda.
	\item Then, $np_0$ is the number of people who correctly identified
	the soda, and $np_0 = 53 > 10$.
	\item $n(1-p_0)$ is the number of people who incorrectly identified the
	soda, and $n(1-p_0)= 27 > 10$.
	\item The normal model is hence appropriate.
\end{itemize}

\section{Do}

Formula for 1-sample z-test:

$$
z=\frac{\hat{p}-p_0}{\sqrt{\frac{p_0(1-p_0)}{n}}}, p_0 = 0.5, \hat{p} = 0.6625, n = 80
$$

Our resulting $z$-score is 2.907, which corresponds to a $p$-value of 0.002.

\section{Conclude}

Since $p = 0.002 < 0.05$ we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there
is strong evidence that people are able to detect the difference between diet
and regular soda.
