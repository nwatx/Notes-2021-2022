### Main files

There are several main files and directories you need to keep track of.

`/template/` - contains a copy-pastable template to be used for notes.

Each template folder contains

`src` - where you put your daily notes in format: YYYYMMDD, or any other method you may prefer.

A `*.tex` file. This file will act as the culmination of every other file.

Inside each template file there should be comments on how to use them.
